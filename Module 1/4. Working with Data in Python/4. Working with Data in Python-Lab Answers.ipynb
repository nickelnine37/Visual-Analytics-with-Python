We start running away and hiding in the bushes. I am next to the road and realize I must stop traffic because the building is going to fall on the road. I run onto the road yelling at the pedestrians to stop! Some ignore me and break past me, walking into the dangerous area. I see the building and actually try to visualize it falling because it isn't and I've got all these people stopped and they are annoyed at me. It finally collapses far away from the road.

When I get there finally he's rather perturbed because he's got a group together and they're wanting to go someplace for breakfast and work there. I didn't even know about the group - he's arranged this because he's going out of town and is taking care of everybody at once. His house is interesting, with a kind of close front door and entry going back to a kitchen/dining area and the group is in a room left of that. Kitchen light is yellow. They've all had to wait, not just for me, but 1 or 2 others, and now we all get up and leave for someplace, maybe Denny's. I get back in the car - it's either raining or been raining and this is an old convertible, maybe a sports car, top up. I have to take my male cousin's dog with me - it's maybe a Basset Hound and typically morose-looking, willing to be shunted round but not enthusiastic. We leave. On the way I decide, hell, I'm not hungry, and this doesn't sound that great, I'm not gonna go. So I just take off on my own path\n",

We export ice from the woods to earn our living, and I am taking part in a large expedition of many woodsmen to make a big ice delivery to the city. A. The deer comes along. I pull by hand a cart filled with large ice blocks along an unpaved, bumpy trail. It is hard work. After passing through a thick wood the deer and I stop in a meadow where I brake the cart so I may rest a few minutes. The deer jumps on top of the ice blocks and sits down there. She likes it! More woodsmen pass through the meadow and they think it is humorous to see a deer that likes sitting on ice blocks. The woodsmen and I sit around the cart laughing for a while and everyone is content. \n",
      "I am in the mountains. Skiing in the red sand. The morning program is over and a woman is trying to convince me to go trekking. I go up to woman and ask her what she wants and she says she just wants a chat. She says a slow trek is much more introspective. But I want either her or to go skiing. So I go over to the ski shop. A Japanese man is trying to rent me skis with very old bindings. I refuse and say I want skis with bindings from at least 1970. He finds the bindings. But the wind is coming up so hard that I can't go skiing anymore. I am on the trek. There was a murder to be committed and I thought that one of the brothers was doing it. But it appeared that one of the other brothers, young Ethan, was going to kill the prime minister. He was an evil man. (Ethan or the prime minister?) I get goose bumps when I see this young man, Ethan, going down the mountain. He is singing the romantic lead in Fiddler on the Roof. He is very excited. But he is not going to see his own baby son because he does not want to confuse him by just appearing shortly and then disappearing again\n"
