I am from the woods and my pet cat. She is somehow a deer, not a cat. We export ice from the woods to earn our living, and I am taking part in a large expedition of many woodsmen to make a big ice delivery to the city. A. The deer comes along. I pull by hand a cart filled with large ice blocks along an unpaved, bumpy trail. It is hard work. After passing through a thick wood the deer and I stop in a meadow where I brake the cart so I may rest a few minutes. The deer jumps on top of the ice blocks and sits down there. She likes it! More woodsmen pass through the meadow and they think it is humorous to see a deer that likes sitting on ice blocks. The woodsmen and I sit around the cart laughing for a while and everyone is content.
