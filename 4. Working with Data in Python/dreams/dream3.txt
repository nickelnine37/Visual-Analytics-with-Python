A tall many-storied building stands near a road. A construction crew is looking for a structural problem. I go into the building to the basement and I see a twisted place in a girder, a long beam. I come out and tell the foreman the building is about to collapse. We start running away and hiding in the bushes. I am next to the road and realize I must stop traffic because the building is going to fall on the road. I run onto the road yelling at the pedestrians to stop! Some ignore me and break past me, walking into the dangerous area. I see the building and actually try to visualize it falling because it isn't and I've got all these people stopped and they are annoyed at me. It finally collapses far away from the road. A person glares at me for hindering them. I shrug. Better safe than sorry.
