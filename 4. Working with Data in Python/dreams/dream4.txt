I am in the mountains. Skiing in the red sand. The morning program is over and a woman is trying to convince me to go trekking. I go up to woman and ask her what she wants and she says she just wants a chat. She says a slow trek is much more introspective. But I want either her or to go skiing. So I go over to the ski shop. A Japanese man is trying to rent me skis with very old bindings. I refuse and say I want skis with bindings from at least 1970. He finds the bindings. But the wind is coming up so hard that I can't go skiing anymore. I am on the trek. There was a murder to be committed and I thought that one of the brothers was doing it. But it appeared that one of the other brothers, young Ethan, was going to kill the prime minister. He was an evil man. (Ethan or the prime minister?) I get goose bumps when I see this young man, Ethan, going down the mountain. He is singing the romantic lead in Fiddler on the Roof. He is very excited. But he is not going to see his own baby son because he does not want to confuse him by just appearing shortly and then disappearing again
