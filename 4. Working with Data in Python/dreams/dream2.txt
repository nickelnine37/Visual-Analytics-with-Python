I'm driving to my male cousin's for my appointment - I'm with somebody else and I'm late for some reason. When I get there finally he's rather perturbed because he's got a group together and they're wanting to go someplace for breakfast and work there. I didn't even know about the group - he's arranged this because he's going out of town and is taking care of everybody at once. His house is interesting, with a kind of close front door and entry going back to a kitchen/dining area and the group is in a room left of that. Kitchen light is yellow. They've all had to wait, not just for me, but 1 or 2 others, and now we all get up and leave for someplace, maybe Denny's. I get back in the car - it's either raining or been raining and this is an old convertible, maybe a sports car, top up. I have to take my male cousin's dog with me - it's maybe a Basset Hound and typically morose-looking, willing to be shunted round but not enthusiastic. We leave. On the way I decide, hell, I'm not hungry, and this doesn't sound that great, I'm not gonna go. So I just take off on my own path
